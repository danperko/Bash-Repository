echo -e "\nChosen options:": Displays a message on the screen.
echo "Search for: $search_text": Shows the text to search for entered by the user.

Prompt user for option selection:

read -p $'\nOptions:\n1. Confirm\n2. Enter data again\n3. Cancel\nChoose an option: ' choice: Shows a menu of options and asks the user to choose an option, storing the choice in the variable choice.
